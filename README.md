# Script for testing PRP HW
Use as you wish, but at your own risk.
## Warnings
Current version autodeletes folder data/ before creating new one for the files. So any important files in data/ will be lost
## Issues/ bugs / feature requests
If you encounter any problem, you can fix it yourself or try to contact me at:

## Plans for Version 3.0
Less verobse version - it only echoes diffs where any issues were found. Some parameters like repeat number.
